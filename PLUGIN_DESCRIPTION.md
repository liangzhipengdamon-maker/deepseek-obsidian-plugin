## Overview

DeepSeek AI Assistant is a powerful Obsidian plugin that integrates DeepSeek's advanced AI capabilities directly into your note-taking workflow. This plugin transforms Obsidian into an intelligent knowledge management system by providing AI-powered assistance for content creation, analysis, and discovery.

## Key Features

### 🤖 AI Chat Interface
Experience a Copilot-style conversational interface with real-time streaming responses and visible reasoning processes. The chat interface supports multi-turn conversations with persistent history across Obsidian sessions.

### 🔍 Knowledge Base Integration
The plugin intelligently searches your Obsidian vault to provide contextual information for AI responses, enabling the AI to understand and reference your existing notes and knowledge.

### 📊 Content Analysis & Enhancement
Transform your notes with AI-powered analysis, summarization, and enhancement capabilities:
- **Analyze**: Get detailed insights and improvement suggestions for your content
- **Summarize**: Create concise summaries of lengthy notes
- **Enhance**: Improve clarity, structure, and expressiveness of your writing

### ⚡ Multiple Access Points
Interact with the AI assistant through various convenient methods:
- Command palette integration
- Right-click context menu for selected text
- Dedicated sidebar panel
- Floating chat dialog

### 🔒 Privacy First
Your data privacy is paramount:
- All API calls are made locally from your device
- Your knowledge base content is only used for context and never stored or transmitted beyond the API call
- API keys are securely stored in Obsidian's local configuration
- Read-only access ensures your notes remain unchanged
